To avoid issues over who owns copyright to specific contributions,
our code should ship with a very simple Contributors' License Agreement

*** START OF AGREEMENT ***
```
“Blood Rose” refers to Blood Rose Records, including any projects operated under that name.
By submitting a contribution to this project, I hereby represent and warrant that:

1. I am the owner of the contributed work and I have the right to submit it.
2. I knowingly assign all rights in the contribution, including copyright, to Blood Rose.
3. Blood Rose may use, modify, distribute, sublicense, or relicense the contribution for any purpose, including commercial or proprietary use.
4. I accept responsibility for claims arising from contributions I submit.

Blood Rose, in response, agrees that:

1. The contribution will be made available under the license or licenses in use by the project at the time of submission.
2. The contributor will be credited for their contribution(s).

Blood Rose reserves the right to remove or replace contributions at any time without notice.
